<p id="hd">CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
<br>
<p>CSS id selector is used to select the HTML element using the ID attribute to apply a style to it. This id element is distinctive always inside the page, and hence it is preferred for selecting a distinct, unique HTML element. When you want to apply the style to only one HTML tag at a time on a page, then you can use the ID selector.
</p>
<div class="center">The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. To do this, start with the element name, then write the period (.) character, followed by the name of the class
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
