<h2>Tree</h2>
<center>
<p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem,
 or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages,
 the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants
 with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above 
 a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, 
 bananas, and bamboos are also trees. </p>
