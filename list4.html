<p><i><h3>A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. 
Trees can live for many years. The oldest tree ever discovered is approximately 5,000 years old and the oldest tree from
 the UK is about 1,000. 
The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves.
